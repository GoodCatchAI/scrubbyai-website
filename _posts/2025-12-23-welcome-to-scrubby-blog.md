We're excited to launch the Scrubby blog — your source for updates on our progress, technical deep-dives into how Scrubby works, and insights on managing AI-assisted code quality.

## What to expect

As we build out Scrubby, we'll be sharing:

- **Product updates** — New features, improvements, and roadmap progress
- **Technical content** — How we approach pattern detection, convention learning, and code analysis
- **Best practices** — Tips for teams adopting AI coding assistants while maintaining code quality
- **Community stories** — How teams are using Scrubby to shift quality left

## Stay tuned

We're in active development and onboarding beta users. If you haven't already, [sign up for the beta](/#join) to get early access.

More posts coming soon!
